# RCNN  recurrent convolutional nerual network for text classification
my simple adapt for recurrent convolutional nerual network for text classification
except different learning rate for differnet layers,using glove word vector
i got 88% acuration without  altering paramters carefully in 20 classes
you can change some hypeparamters in rcnn.py 
for training just run rcnn.py
for predict.py may not work
